                        professional boxer, activist, entertainer, poet and philanthropist. </p>

            <br>
            <p> He was named after his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr., who had a sister and four brothers
                and who himself was named in honor of the 19th-century Republican politician and staunch abolitionist
                Cassius Marcellus Clay, also from the state of Kentucky. Clay's father's paternal grandparents were John
                Clay and Sallie Anne Clay; Clay's sister Eva claimed that Sallie was a native of Madagascar. He was
                a descendant of slaves of the antebellum South, and was predominantly of African descent, with some
                Irish and English family heritage. Ali's maternal great-grandfather, Abe Grady, emigrated
                from Ennis, Co. Clare, Ireland. DNA testing performed in 2018 showed that, through his paternal
                grandmother, Ali was a descendant of the former slave Archer Alexander, who had been chosen from the
                building crew as the model of a freed man for the Emancipation Memorial, and was the subject of
                abolitionist William Greenleaf Eliot's book, The Story of Archer Alexander: From Slavery to Freedom.
                Like Ali, Alexander fought for his freedom.
                <br><br>

                His father was a sign and billboard painter, and his mother, Odessa O'Grady Clay (1917–1994), was a
                domestic helper. Although Cassius Sr. was a Methodist, he allowed Odessa to bring up both Cassius Jr.
                and his younger brother, Rudolph "Rudy" Clay (later renamed Rahman Ali), as Baptists. Cassius Jr.
                attended Central High School in Louisville. He was dyslexic, which led to difficulties in reading and
                writing, at school and for much of his life. Ali grew up amid racial segregation. His mother
                recalled one occasion when he was denied a drink of water at a store—"They wouldn't give him one because
                of his color. That really affected him." He was also strongly affected by the 1955 murder of Emmett
                Till, which led to young Clay and a friend taking out their frustration by vandalizing a local rail
                yard. His daughter Hana later wrote that Ali once told her, "Nothing would ever shake me up (more) than
                the story of Emmett Till."
                <br><br>

                Ali was first directed toward boxing by Louisville police officer and boxing coach Joe E. Martin,
                who encountered the 12-year-old fuming over a thief's having taken his bicycle. He told the officer he
                was going to "whup" the thief. The officer told Clay he had better learn how to box first.
                Initially, Clay did not take up Martin's offer, but after seeing amateur boxers on a local television
                boxing program called Tomorrow's Champions, Clay was interested in the prospect of fighting. He then
                began to work with trainer Fred Stoner, whom he credits with giving him the "real training", eventually
                molding "my style, my stamina and my system." For the last four years of Clay's amateur career he was
                trained by boxing cutman Chuck Bodak.
                <br><br>

                Clay made his amateur boxing debut in 1954 against local amateur boxer Ronnie O'Keefe. He won by split
                decision. He went on to win six Kentucky Golden Gloves titles, two national Golden Gloves titles, an
                Amateur Athletic Union national title, and the light heavyweight gold medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics
                in Rome. Clay's amateur record was 100 wins with five losses. Ali said in his 1975 autobiography
                that shortly after his return from the Rome Olympics, he threw his gold medal into the Ohio River after
                he and a friend were refused service at a "whites-only" restaurant and fought with a white gang. The
                story was later disputed, and several of Ali's friends, including Bundini Brown and photographer Howard
                Bingham, denied it. Brown told Sports Illustrated writer Mark Kram, "Honkies sure bought into that one!"
                Thomas Hauser's biography of Ali stated that Ali was refused service at the diner but that he lost his
                medal a year after he won it. Ali received a replacement medal at a basketball intermission during
                the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, where he lit the torch to start the games.

            <ul class="py-4">
                <li> Clay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over Tunney
                    Hunsaker. From then until the end of 1963, Clay amassed a record of 19–0 with 15 wins by knockout.
                    He defeated boxers including Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson, Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George
                    Logan, Willi Besmanoff, LaMar Clark, Doug Jones and Henry Cooper. Clay also beat his former trainer
                    and veteran boxer Archie Moore in a 1962 match.</li>
                <li>These early fights were not without trials. Clay was knocked down by both Sonny Banks and Cooper. In
                    the Cooper fight, Clay was floored by a left hook at the end of round four and was saved by the
                    bell, going on to win in the predicted 5th round due to Cooper's severely cut eye. The fight with
                    Doug Jones on March 13, 1963 was Clay's toughest fight during this stretch. The number two and three
                    heavyweight contenders respectively, Clay and Jones fought on Jones' home turf at New York's Madison
                    Square Garden. Jones staggered Clay in the first round, and the unanimous decision for Clay was
                    greeted by boos and a rain of debris thrown into the ring. Watching on closed-circuit TV,
                    heavyweight champ Sonny Liston quipped that if he fought Clay he might get locked up for murder. The
                    fight was later named "Fight of the Year" by The Ring magazine.</li>

                <li> Ali was married four times and had seven daughters and two sons. </li>
                <li> Ali was introduced to cocktail waitress Sonji Roi by Herbert Muhammad and asked her to marry him
                    after their first date. They were wed approximately one month later on August 14, 1964. They
                    quarreled over Sonji's refusal to join the Nation Of Islam.</li>
                <li> On August 17, 1967, Ali married Belinda Boyd. Born into a Chicago family that had converted to the
                    Nation Of Islam, she later changed her name to Khalilah Ali, though she was still called Belinda by
                    old friends and family. They had four children: author and rapper Maryum "May May" (born 1968);
                    twins Jamillah and Rasheda (born 1970), who married Robert Walsh and has a son, Biaggio Ali, born in
                    1998; and Muhammad Ali Jr. (born 1972). Rasheda's son Nico is a professional boxer.</li>
                <li> By the summer of 1977, his second marriage ended due to Ali's repeated infidelity, and he had
                    married actress and model Veronica Porché.[154] At the time of their marriage, they had a daughter,
                    Hana, and Veronica was pregnant with their second child. Their second daughter, Laila Ali, was born
                    in December 1977. By 1986, Ali and Porché were divorced due to Ali's continuous infidelity.</li>
                <li> On November 19, 1986, Ali married Yolanda "Lonnie" Williams. Lonnie first met Ali at the age of 6
                    when her family moved to Louisville in 1963. In 1982, she became Ali's primary caregiver and in
                    return, he paid for her to attend graduate school at UCLA. Together they adopted a son, Asaad
                    Amin (born 1986), when Asaad was five months old. In 1992, Lonnie incorporated Greatest of All
                    Time, Inc. (G.O.A.T. Inc) to consolidate and license his intellectual properties for commercial
                    purposes. She served as the vice president and treasurer until the sale of the company in 2006.</li>

                <li> Ali was hospitalized in Scottsdale, Arizona, on June 2, 2016, with a respiratory illness. Though
                    his condition was initially described as fair, it worsened, and he died the following day at the age
                    of 74 from septic shock. </li>
                <li> Following Ali's death, he was the number-one trending topic on Twitter for over 12 hours and on
                    Facebook for several days. BET played their documentary Muhammad Ali: Made In Miami. ESPN played
                    four hours of non-stop commercial-free coverage of Ali. News networks, such as ABC News, BBC, CNN,
                    and Fox News, also covered him extensively.

                    He was mourned globally, and a family spokesman said the family "certainly believes that Muhammad
                    was a citizen of the world ... and they know that the world grieves with him." Politicians such
                    as Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, David Cameron and more paid tribute to
                    Ali. Ali also received numerous tributes from the world of sports including Michael Jordan, Tiger
                    Woods, Floyd Mayweather, Mike Tyson, the Miami Marlins, LeBron James, Steph Curry and more.
                    Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer stated, "Muhammad Ali belongs to the world. But he only has one
                    hometown."

                    The day after Ali's death, the UFC paid tribute to Ali at their UFC 199 event in a lengthy video
                    tribute package, crediting Ali for his accomplishments and inspiring multiple UFC champions.

                <li> Ali's funeral had been pre-planned by himself and others for several years prior to his actual
                    death. The services began in Louisville on June 9, 2016, with an Islamic Janazah prayer service
                    at Freedom Hall on the grounds of the Kentucky Exposition Center. On June 10, 2016, the funeral
                    procession passed through the streets of Louisville ending at Cave Hill Cemetery, where his body was
                    interred during a private ceremony. A public memorial service for Ali at downtown Louisville's KFC
                    Yum! Center was held during the afternoon of June 10. The pallbearers included Will
                    Smith, Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson, with honorary pallbearers including George Chuvalo, Larry Holmes
                    and George Foreman. Ali's memorial was watched by an estimated 1 billion viewers
                    worldwide.</li>
